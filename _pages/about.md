I am a Cyber-Physical Systems engineer with a unique blend of IoT expertise and extensive electrical engineering experience. Recently graduating with an **MS in Cyber-Physical Systems** (3.798 GPA) from Northeastern University Toronto, I bridge the gap between physical infrastructure and digital technologies.

With over a decade of industry experience in electrical engineering and MEP coordination for large-scale projects, I bring a practical understanding of how IoT technologies can transform traditional systems. I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions that leverage advanced technologies to create more efficient, sustainable, and intelligent systems.
